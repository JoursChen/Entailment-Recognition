# Entailment-Recognition
Sequence-to-Label Learning

Textual entailment (TE) in natural language processing is a directional relation between text fragments. 
The relation holds whenever the truth of one text fragment follows from another text. In this project, the
dateset is downloaded from SNLI Corpus, which is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs 
manually labeled for balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral.

Example:
A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country
The man is sleeping
contradiction
